\section{Goals}
Technical objectives I aim to acheive
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a efficient historical Bitcoin data extractor for storage in a database - designing the historical collection process to run over several hours, rather than several weeks, as in previous work \cite{RefWorks:doc:5c98e031e4b068320632cef2}.
    \item Implement a mechanism for writing new Bitcoin data to the database upon new blocks being confirmed by the network.
    \item Implement a system for fetching historical Bitcoin price data for each Block at the time it was mined.
    \item Implement a system for building a dataset which maps bitcoin addresses to known entities of the bitcoin networks (e.g. exchanges, gambling sites, other services etc.) and generate relationships to write to the database for these mappings.
    \item Implement an API which interfaces the database
    \item \todo{Fill this in}
\end{enumerate}
