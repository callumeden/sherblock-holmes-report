	title={Data-Driven De-Anonymization inBitcoin&nbsp;},
	institution={ETH Zurich},
	abstract={We analyse the performance of several clustering algorithms in the digital peer-to-peer currency Bitcoin. Clustering in Bitcoin refers to the task of findingaddresses that belongs to the same wallet as a given address.In order to assess the effectiveness of clustering strategies we exploit a vulner-ability in the implementation of Connection Bloom Filtering to capture groundtruth data about 37,585 Bitcoin wallets and the addresses they own. In additionto well-known clustering techniques, we introduce two new strategies, apply themon addresses of the collected wallets and evaluate precision and recall using theground truth. Due to the nature of the Connection Bloom Filtering vulnerabilitythe data we collect is not without errors. We present a method to correct theperformance metrics in the presence of such inaccuracies.Our results demonstrate that even modern wallet software can not protect itsusers properly. Even with the most basic clustering technique known as multi-input heuristic, an adversary can guess on average 68.59% addresses of a victim.We show that this metric can be further improved by combining several moresophisticated heuristics.}

	title={Blockchain explorer: An analytical process and investigation environment for bitcoin},
	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={9-16},
	abstract={Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency currently operating with a total marketcap of almost 7 billion USD. This innovation stands strong on the feature of pseudo anonymity and strives on its innovative de-centralized architecture based on the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger that keeps a public record of all the transactions processed on the bitcoin protocol network in full transparency without revealing the identity of the sender and the receiver. Over the course of 2016, cryptocurrencies have shown some instances of abuse by criminals in their activities due to its interesting nature. Darknet marketplaces are increasing the volume of their businesses in illicit and illegal trades but also cryptocurrencies have been used in cases of extortion, ransom and as part of sophisticated malware modus operandi. We tackle these challenges by developing an analytical capability that allows us to map relationships on the blockchain and filter crime instances in order to investigate the abuse in law enforcement local environment. We propose a practical bitcoin analytical process and an analyzing system that stands alone and manages all data on the blockchain in real-time with tracing and visualizing techniques rendering transactions decipherable and useful for law enforcement investigation and training. Our system adopts combination of analyzing methods that provides statistics of address, graphical transaction relation, discovery of paths and clustering of already known addresses. We evaluated our system in the three criminal cases includes marketplace, ransomware and DDoS extortion. These are practical training in law enforcement, then we determined whether our system could help investigation process and training.},

	title={Anonymity of Bitcoin Transactions An Analysis of Mixing Services},
	abstract={Bitcoin, a distributed, cryptographic, digital currency, gained a lot of media attention for being an anonymous e-cash system. But as all transactions in the network are stored publicly in the blockchain, allowing anyone to inspect and analyze them, the system does not provide real anonymity but pseudonymity. There have already been studies showing the possibility to deanonymize bitcoin users based on the transaction graph and publicly available data. Furthermore, users could be tracked by bitcoin exchanges or shops, where they have to provide personal information that can then be linked to their bitcoin addresses. Special bitcoin mixing services claim to obfuscate the origin of transactions and thereby increase the anonymity of its users. In this paper we evaluate three of these services – Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry, and the Send Shared functionality of Blockchain.info – by analyzing the transaction graph. While Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info successfully mix our transaction, we are able to find a direct relation between the input and output transactions in the graph of BitLaundry.}
